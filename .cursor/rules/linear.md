2. When discussing tasks, always refer to the Linear issue ID with a link, e.g. `[MG-16](https://linear.app/maybegood/issue/MG-16/setup-trails-mono-repo-structure)`.

## Linear Workflow

1. Always keep issue fields up to date, e.g. `status`, `priority`, `label`, etc.
2. If you work on a task, update the `assignee` to yourself.
3. If you need the user to do something, create a new issue and assign it to `mg` with detailed instructions.
4. Upon finishing a task, add a comment to the issue with the details of your work.
